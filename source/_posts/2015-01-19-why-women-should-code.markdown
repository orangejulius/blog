A few days ago, an article titled _Why Women Shouldn't Code_, perhaps the ultimate click-bait
headline, was posted on Medium. There were already great responses by
[Kelly Ellis](https://medium.com/@hardaway/why-women-shouldnt-code-82205165e64a) and
[Jenn Schiffer](http://negativitysandwiches.com/post/108299473795/a-quick-and-dirty-annotation-of-why-women)
by the time I read it, but I quickly started drafting up my own comments.

I wrote my response assuming that the author of _Why Women Shouldn't Code_ was just another "old
white dude" telling women what to do. Embarrassingly, I discovered that in fact the author was a
woman! Here I was, trying to write some words supporting gender equality, and I made the classic
mistake of assuming everyone on the internet is a man. Oops.

It's often said that no-one thinks they are part of the problem of sexism, and this was a good
reminder that it really takes a lot of work to over come biases that are common in society. I'll try
to do better next time.

After all this I was really wondering if I should even publish anything about the original
article. The internet is already full of men telling women what to do or think. Finally I decided
that it is worth speaking up about, if nothing else because I want to make it clear, on my own blog,
what my own opinions are. But also, _Why Women Shouldn't Code_ has some seriously wrong assumptions
about the nature of coding, something I hold very near and dear. So let's talk.

## On the Innate Differences Between Men and Women
Sure, you don't need to do a brain scan to discover there are biological differences between men and
women.

But taking the leap from "the part of the brain that we think is somewhat responsible for extremely
high level activity X is slightly bigger in men, on average" to "thing X should only be done by men"
is simply not a viable line of thought.

Proving differences in aptitude of any high level skill is almost impossible to support with
science. There is way too much complexity in the human experience to ever come to a meaningful
conclusion.

Besides, we can't even measure the differences in productivity between teams of software developers
even if we try to make the composition of the team as identical as possible. Given the same
requirements, different groups of developers won't even build the same thing. One team wouldn't
even build the same thing given a second chance.

Part of what makes creating software hard is that we don't conclusively know what makes a team good
or bad at it, even though we've been doing it for at least 70 years{% fn %}. Under those conditions, is
it really wise to exclude 50% of the population from contributing?

Most importantly, even if we did some day conclusively prove that on average the biology of a woman
makes her less adept at writing code, who cares? Men do things that women are supposedly better at
all the time, and no one bats an eye. [Let them code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRUS8Zvg3sg).

## On the Definition of the Profession of "coding"

If a software job simply consists of writing a program to do exactly what someone else tells
you it should do, then there's no question why women don't want that job: that job sucks. No
one wants that job.

Fortunately, while probably more common than we'd like, that job isn't something that's
really needed. What we _do_ need are people who can not only write good code, but talk to other people
who are experts in other things, and together build something that is both useful and possible to
build in a reasonable amount of time, for a reasonable cost. This job is hard, it requires technical
AND people skills, and many people find it extremely enjoyable.

By the way, you don't even have to code as part of a job. Coding can simply be done for fun, on your
own, or with some friends, or even random strangers from the internet.

Even after robots have taken over the world and humans just sit back on their space cruise ships,
someone will surely still be writing code for fun (probably even code that a million other people
have already written). No one needs to tell you what to code, and you don't even need to ask
permission.  That's why it's awesome. It's the pure joy of creation{% fn %}.

## On 16 "Data Points" Being Enough to Prove Something

When you go to a toy store, the boys section is filled with superheroes, trucks, trains and
airplanes. The girls section is filled with dolls and fake kitchens. Do we make fake kitchen toys
for girls because that's what they like, or is that what they like because that's what we make them?

These sort of questions of causation have confounded humanity for so long that the entire idea of
science was created to help answer them. While still lacking, there are a number of tools that we
have today to help. Sample sizes should be large, biases in selecting the samples should be taken
into account, and the study itself should be administered as a double-blind trial, all to make sure
we aren't tricking ourselves.

What definitely ISN'T in that toolkit is cherry-picking a handful of stories from people who's lives
we personally have had a long and significant influence over, and using those stories to support a
belief we've had since before those people existed.
