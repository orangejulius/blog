## The Source Code

This is the source code for my website, [juliansimioni.com](https://juliansimioni.com).

It was originally based on [Octopress](http://octopress.org), but I've modified
it so much I consider it mostly separate now.

Nonetheless, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to Octopress for making
my life easier (sometimes).
